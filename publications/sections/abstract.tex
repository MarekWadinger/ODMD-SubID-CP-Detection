We propose an interpretable online change-point detection (CPD) method based on online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (ODMDwC). Leveraging DMD's ability to find and track linear approximation of a non-linear system while incorporating control effects, the proposed method dynamically adapts to its changing behavior due to aging and seasonality. This approach enables the detection of changes in spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns, providing a robust solution that preserves correspondence between the score and the extent of change in the system dynamics. We formulate a truncated version of ODMDwC and utilize higher-order time-delay embeddings to mitigate noise and extract broad-band features. Our method addresses the challenges faced in industrial settings where safety-critical systems generate non-uniform data streams while requiring timely and accurate change-point detection to protect both profit and life. Our results demonstrate that this method yields intuitive and improved detection accuracy compared to the SVD-based CPD method. We validate our approach using synthetic and real-world data, showing its competitiveness to other approaches on complex systems' benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we provide intuitive guidelines for selecting hyperparameters, enhancing our method's practical applicability.
