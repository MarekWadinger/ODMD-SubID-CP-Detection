This sets the stage for fast and memory-efficient sequential algorithms for tracking singular values and subspaces. In conjunction with a fast solution for the pseudo-inverse of a submatrix of an orthogonal matrix, we develop a scheme for computing a thin SVD of streaming data in a single pass with linear time complexity: A rank-r thin SVD of a p×q matrix can be computed in O(pqr) time for r⩽min(p,q).},

@article{Gottwald2020,
  abstract = {We employ the framework of the Koopman operator and dynamic mode decomposition to devise a computationally cheap and easily implementable method to detect transient dynamics and regime changes in time series. We argue that typically transient dynamics experiences the full state space dimension with subsequent fast relaxation towards the attractor. In equilibrium, on the other hand, the dynamics evolves on a slower time scale on a lower dimensional attractor. The reconstruction error of a dynamic mode decomposition is used to monitor the inability of a time series to resolve the fast relaxation towards the attractor as well as the effective dimension of the dynamics. We illustrate our method by detecting transient dynamics in the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We further apply our method to atmospheric reanalysis data; our diagnostics detects the transition from a predominantly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to a predominantly positive NAO around 1970, as well as the recently found regime change in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation around 1970.},

Our algorithms are derived from the principle that the subspace spanned by the columns of an observability matrix and the one spanned by the subsequences of time-series data are approximately equivalent. In this paper, we derive a batch-type algorithm applicable to ordinary time-series data, i.e. consisting of only output series, and then introduce the online version of the algorithm and the extension to be available with input-output time-series data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms with comparative experiments using some artificial and real datasets.},

@article{Kuehn2011,
  abstract = {Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to transition to far-away attractors. The terms “critical transition” or “tipping point” have been used to describe this situation. Critical transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future directions of the theory.},

@article{Proctor2016,
  abstract = { We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations---only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation). },

In its most common form, it processes high-dimensional sequential measurements, extracts coherent structures, isolates dynamic behavior, and reduces complex evolution processes to their dominant features and essential components. The decomposition is intimately related to Koopman analysis and, since its introduction, has spawned various extensions, generalizations, and improvements. It has been applied to numerical and experimental data sequences taken from simple to complex fluid systems and has also had an impact beyond fluid dynamics in, for example, video surveillance, epidemiology, neurobiology, and financial engineering. This review focuses on the practical aspects of DMD and its variants, as well as on its usage and characteristics as a quantitative tool for the analysis of complex fluid processes.},

  abstract = { Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal decomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of “windowed DMD,” in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble. },

  abstract      = {ncremental singular value decomposition (SVD) was proposed by Brand to efficiently compute the SVD of a matrix. The algorithm needs to compute thousands or millions of orthogonal matrices and to multiply them together. However, the multiplications may corrode the orthogonality. Hence many reorthogonalizations are needed in practice. In [Linear Algebra and its Applications 415 (2006) 20-30], Brand asked "It is an open question how often this is necessary to guarantee a certain overall level of numerical precision; it does not change the overall complexity." In this paper, we answer this question and the answer is we can avoid computing the large amount of those orthogonal matrices and hence the reorthogonalizations are not necessary by modifying his algorithm. We prove that the modification does not change the outcomes of the algorithm. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of our modification.},
