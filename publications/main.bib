  abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing process monitoring is crucial to ensure production quality. This paper formulates the detection problem of abnormal changes in the manufacturing process as the change point detection (CPD) problem for the industrial temporal data. The premise of known data property and sufficient data annotations in existing CPD methods limits their application in the complex manufacturing process. Therefore, a self-supervised and non-parametric CPD method based on temporal trend-seasonal feature decomposition and contrastive learning (CoCPD) is proposed. CoCPD aims to solve CPD problem in an online manner. By bringing the representations of time series segments with similar properties in the feature space closer, our model can sensitively distinguish the change points that do not conform to either historical data distribution or temporal continuity. The proposed CoCPD is validated by a real-world body-in-white production case and compared with 10 state-of-the-art CPD methods. Overall, CoCPD achieves promising results by Precision 70.6%, Recall 68.8%, and the mean absolute error (MAE) 8.27. With the ability to rival the best offline baselines, CoCPD outperforms online baseline methods with improvements in Precision, Recall and MAE by 14.90%, 11.93% and 43.93%, respectively. Experiment results demonstrate that CoCPD can detect abnormal changes timely and accurately.},

Also, Koopman operator theory has long-standing connections to known system-theoretic and dynamical system notions that are not universally recognized. Given the former and latter realities, this work aims to bridge the gap between various concepts regarding both theory and tractable realizations. Firstly, we review data-driven representations (both unstructured and structured) for Koopman operator dynamical models, categorizing various existing methodologies and highlighting their differences. Furthermore, we provide concise insight into the paradigm's relation to system-theoretic notions and analyze the prospect of using the paradigm for modeling control systems.

One problem with neural networks is that they are sensitive to noise and often require large data sets to work robustly, while increasing data size makes them slow. As a result, there are only a few existing works in the literature on the use of neural networks in outlier detection. This paper shows that neural networks can be a very competitive technique to other existing methods. The basic idea is to randomly vary on the connectivity architecture of the autoencoder to obtain significantly better performance. Furthermore, we combine this technique with an adaptive sampling method to make our approach more efficient and effective. Experimental results comparing the proposed approach with state-of-the-art detectors are presented on several benchmark data sets showing the accuracy of our approach. },

Although this thread of research has recently received increased interest, most lifelong machine learning approaches proposed thus far focus on object recognition or classification tasks. In contrast, lifelong approaches for anomaly detection are still unexplored. This paper presents a method for lifelong anomaly detection loosely based on biological principles, which can adapt to the environment and efficiently recall old information from its memory bank. Inspired by the interaction between the cortex and the hippocampus in biology, we combine deep learning with statistical change point detection. Our method induces concepts from its environment and organizes them in a semantically coherent forest structure in an unsupervised manner. At runtime, we analyze new objects, one by one, with respect to the current forest of concepts. If a new object fits an existing concept, it is added to the pool of objects representing that concept. Otherwise, it is further analyzed to determine whether it represents a new concept, a new sub-concept, or it is an anomaly. Experiments conducted over different applied settings show that the synergic interaction of change point detection with an evolving forest of concepts yields a higher anomaly detection performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent CPD methods demonstrated the potential of using deep learning techniques, but often lack the ability to identify more subtle changes in the autocorrelation statistics of the signal and suffer from a high false alarm rate. To address these issues, we employ an autoencoder-based methodology with a novel loss function, through which the used autoencoders learn a partially time-invariant representation that is tailored for CPD. The result is a flexible method that allows the user to indicate whether change points should be sought in the time domain, frequency domain or both. Detectable change points include abrupt changes in the slope, mean, variance, autocorrelation function and frequency spectrum. We demonstrate that our proposed method is consistently highly competitive or superior to baseline methods on diverse simulated and real-life benchmark data sets. Finally, we mitigate the issue of false detection alarms through the use of a postprocessing procedure that combines a matched filter and a newly proposed change point score. We show that this combination drastically improves the performance of our method as well as all baseline methods.},

Our method is based on a convex combination of two decoupled least mean square windowed filters with differing sizes. Both filters are applied independently on data streams obtained from sensor nodes such that their convex combination parameter is employed as an indicator of abrupt changes in mean values.

It provides an enhancement of both convergence and steady-state accuracy of the convex weight parameter.

We provide a non-asymptotic result showing that, with high probability, the KCP procedure retrieves the correct number of change-points, provided that the constant in the penalty is well-chosen; in addition, KCP estimates the change-points location at the optimal rate. As a consequence, when using a characteristic kernel, KCP detects all kinds of change in the distribution (not only changes in the mean or the variance), and it is able to do so for complex structured data (not necessarily in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$). Most of the analysis is conducted assuming that the kernel is bounded; part of the results can be extended when we only assume a finite second-order moment. We also demonstrate KCP on both synthetic and real data.},

In equilibrium, on the other hand, the dynamics evolves on a slower time scale on a lower dimensional attractor. The reconstruction error of a dynamic mode decomposition is used to monitor the inability of a time series to resolve the fast relaxation towards the attractor as well as the effective dimension of the dynamics. We illustrate our method by detecting transient dynamics in the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We further apply our method to atmospheric reanalysis data; our diagnostics detects the transition from a predominantly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to a predominantly positive NAO around 1970, as well as the recently found regime change in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation around 1970.},

  abstract = {The behavior of a time series may be affected by various factors. Changes in mean, variance, frequency, and auto-correlation are the most common. Change-Point Detection (CPD) aims to track down abrupt statistical characteristic changes in time series that can benefit many applications in different domains. As demonstrated in recently introduced CPD methodologies, deep learning approaches have the potential to identify more subtle changes. However, due to improper handling of data and insufficient training, these methodologies generate more false alarms and are not efficient enough in detecting change-points. In real-time CPD algorithms, preprocessed data plays a vital role in increasing the algorithm's efficiency and minimizing false alarm rates. Therefore, preprocessing of data should be a part of the algorithm, but in the existing methods, preprocessing of data is done initially, and then the whole dataset is passed to the CPD algorithm. A new three-phase architecture is proposed to address this issue, in which all phases, from preprocessing to CPD, work in an adaptive manner. The phases are integrated into a pipeline, allowing the algorithm to work in real-time. Our proposed strategy performs optimally and consistently based on performance metrics resulting from experiments on real-world datasets and artifacts. This work effectively addresses the issue of non-stationary data normalization using deep learning approaches. To reduce noise and outliers from the data, a recursive version of singular spectrum analysis is introduced. It is demonstrated that the method's performance has significantly improved by combining adaptive preprocessing with deep learning CPD techniques.},

At each round of ACPD, the task is to adaptively determine the next input, in order to detect the change-point in a black-box expensive-to-evaluate function, with as few evaluations as possible. We propose a novel framework that can be generalized for different types of data and change-points, by utilizing an existing change-point detection method to compute change scores and a Bayesian optimization method to determine the next input.

  abstract = {Since the control laws require sensor feedback to set the current dynamic state of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), incorrect readings may lead to potentially catastrophic conditions. Thus, automated detection and mitigation of UAV flight data anomaly is an important problem in the aviation domain. However, the conventional anomaly detection algorithms simply detect the outlier points and cannot provide estimated values. To address this challenge, anomaly detection and mitigation algorithm based on online subspace tracking, an online algorithm for flight data anomaly detection and mitigation is proposed. At every time instant, data subspace matrix is used as a meaningful data representation of raw multivariate heterogeneous flight data. Besides, in terms of outlier points, the subspace matrix is tracked with incomplete partial observation. Anomaly score is calculated based on the identification of a change in the underlying subspace. Utilizing the tracked subspace matrix, the detected outlier points are replaced with reasonable recovered estimations, which will help mitigate the influence of anomaly to UAV system control. Experimental results on real UAV flight data demonstrate its ability to maintain high accuracy for anomaly detection and low error for data recovery.},

In the proposed scheme, we regard the numbers of connections at multiple base stations as multi-dimensional data, and from the correlation matrix of the multi-dimensional data, the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue is computed sequentially by means of subspace tracking. The eigenvector is transformed to a one-dimensional sequence and change-points are detected by an existing one-dimensional change-point detection scheme. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme with simulation experiments.},

Changes in power system monitoring must be detected as quickly as possible, so that the system operators can choose a different tool for data analysis. Therefore, in this paper, changes in the working conditions of the power system are detected using a subspace state-space based change-point detection method. The detection algorithm proposed in this paper is sequential detection, which aims at both detection accuracy and detection speed. We have tested our proposed algorithm to detect many various kinds of changes in power system operations and verified that the algorithm is able to detect changes successfully, including very small ones in the system such as the low-amplitude forced oscillations buried in the system's ambient conditions in a real-time manner. The algorithm is tested in a set of real-world data to show its practical usage in large systems with imperfect data.},

Exploiting low-dimensional structures (subspace in particular) of high-dimensional signals is another research topic of significance, as it improves not only efficiency in computation, storage, and communication, but also interpretability and understanding of data. In this paper, we formulate the problem of subspace change-point detection, where a stream of high-dimensional data points lie on a low-dimensional subspace that abruptly changes at a certain time instant. Then, we propose a cumulative-sum-based algorithm for the task of detection in this problem setup. From the algorithmic perspective, the proposed method is computationally efficient, as it proceeds in an online and recursive manner, and each iteration involves simple matrix computation; it is also practical and flexible, as it works under mild conditions on the distribution of data points after change point. From the theoretical perspective, we derive rigorous performance bounds of the proposed algorithm in terms of false alarm rate and detection delay. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to validate effectiveness of our algorithm and correctness of theoretical analysis.},

Several fault detection indices in the literature are analyzed and unified. Fault reconstruction for both sensor and process faults is presented which extends the traditional missing value replacement method. Fault diagnosis methods that have appeared recently are reviewed. The reconstruction-based approach and the contribution-based approach are analyzed and compared with simulation and industrial examples. The complementary nature of the reconstruction- and contribution-based approaches is highlighted. An industrial example of polyester film process monitoring is given to demonstrate the power of the contribution- and reconstruction-based approaches in a hierarchical monitoring framework. Finally we demonstrate that the reconstruction-based framework provides a convenient way for fault analysis, including fault detectability, reconstructability and identifiability conditions, resolving many theoretical issues in process monitoring. Additional topics are summarized at the end of the paper for future investigation. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Time series discords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.},

  abstract  = {Continual learning from data streams is among the most important topics in contemporary machine learning. One of the biggest challenges in this domain lies in creating algorithms that can continuously adapt to arriving data. However, previously learned knowledge may become outdated, as streams evolve over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and must be detected to facilitate efficient adaptation of the learning model. While there exists a plethora of drift detectors, all of them assume that we are dealing with roughly balanced classes. In the case of imbalanced data streams, those detectors will be biased towards the majority classes, ignoring changes happening in the minority ones. Furthermore, class imbalance may evolve over time and classes may change their roles (majority becoming minority and vice versa). This is especially challenging in the multi-class setting, where relationships among classes become complex. In this paper, we propose a detailed taxonomy of challenges posed by concept drift in multi-class imbalanced data streams, as well as a novel trainable concept drift detector based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine. It is capable of monitoring multiple classes at once and using reconstruction error to detect changes in each of them independently. Our detector utilizes a skew-insensitive loss function that allows it to handle multiple imbalanced distributions. Due to its trainable nature, it is capable of following changes in a stream and evolving class roles, as well as it can deal with local concept drift occurring in minority classes. Extensive experimental study on multi-class drifting data streams, enriched with a detailed analysis of the impact of local drifts and changing imbalance ratios, confirms the high efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract = {Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to transition to far-away attractors. The terms “critical transition” or “tipping point” have been used to describe this situation. Critical transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future directions of the theory.},

Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

Obtaining a precise description of the flight ground service network is of great importance to the efficient and safe operation of airports. In this study, we constructed a dynamic network model inference framework based on sliding window change point detection. First, a change point detection algorithm was proposed to divide all time points into two parts, namely, a set of possible change points and a set of completely impossible change points, which greatly reduces the true change point search space. Then, two novel change point elimination judgment rules were designed and combined with the structure learning algorithm to achieve iterative optimization within the possible change point sets, obtain the final true change points, and realize precise dynamic network inference. Based on the experimental results, our proposed method has a higher accuracy and computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods, and it can be easily adapted to large-scale datasets. Finally, the proposed model was used in an airport flight ground service analysis. Each day was divided into four stages and the potential dependence relationships between different nodes in each stage were accurately determined. Thus, the model has great practical significance for the accurate scheduling and efficient operation of airport ground services.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is one of the most important research contents in time series data analysis, which is widely used in many fields. In real world, the environment is usually dynamically changing, and the distribution of data changes over time, namely concept drift. The accuracy of static anomaly detection methods is bound to be reduced by concept drift. In addition, there is a sudden concept drift, which is manifested as a abrupt variation in a data point that changes the statistical properties of data. Such a point is called a change point, and it has very similar behavior to an anomaly. However, the existing methods cannot distinguish between anomaly and change point, so the existence of change point will affect the result of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to simultaneously detect anomaly and change point for time series with concept drift. The method is based on the fluctuation features of data and converts the original data into the rate of change of data. It not only solves the concept drift, but also effectively detects and distinguishes anomalies and change points. Experiments on both public and synthetic datasets show that compared with the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, our method is superior to most of the existing works and significantly superior to existing methods for change point detection. It fully demonstrates the superiority of our method in detecting anomalies and change points simultaneously.},

  abstract = { The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extracted dynamic modes are the nonorthogonal eigenvectors of the matrix that best approximates the one-step temporal evolution of the multivariate samples. In the context of dynamical system analysis, the extracted dynamic modes are a generalization of global stability modes. We apply DMD to a data matrix whose rows are linearly independent, additive mixtures of latent time series. We show that when the latent time series are uncorrelated at a lag of one time-step then, in the large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a columnwise normalization, the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus, DMD is a time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise but is different from closely related second-order algorithms such as the second-order blind identification (SOBI) method and the algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction (AMUSE). All can unmix mixed stationary, ergodic Gaussian time series in a way that kurtosis-based independent components analysis fundamentally cannot. We use our insights on single-lag DMD to develop a higher lag extension, analyze the finite sample performance with and without randomly missing data, and identify settings where the higher lag variant can outperform the conventional single-lag variant. We validate our results with numerical simulations and highlight how DMD can be used in changepoint detection. },

@article{Proctor2016,
  abstract = { We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations---only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation). },

  abstract = {Multiple domains involve systems with abruptly changing states, that result in signals with signatures that are corrupted by noise and sensor dynamics. In many applications, prior information on the magnitudes and timing distributions are unknown, compounding the difficulty of filtering such signals. Several non-linear filtering techniques are available with varying efficacies, however only a few offer theoretical guarantees. Recent research has led to a heuristic, iterative, non-linear filtering technique that is found to be effective over a range of applications. In this article, we present this iterative algorithm that learns the distribution of the event magnitude and provides an estimate of when an event has occurred. Here, every iteration involves two stages: the first one providing an estimate of the true signal that uses a prior on the distribution of event magnitudes, followed by the second stage where a distribution of the event magnitudes is computed from an estimate of the true signal. It is shown that with every iterate, the performance of the algorithm only improves and convergence of the posterior probability is established. Our comparative tests show that our algorithm provides significant performance improvements, especially for high bandwidth applications where sensor dynamics cannot be neglected. In addition, we provide a python-based implementation of the algorithm and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods in practice.},

  abstract   = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI. This review will be beneficial for researchers in understanding this field.},

In spite of empirical success of many change point algorithms, there are several unresolved issues: (a) use various probabilistic modeling assumptions in one form and another, (b) fail when there are multiple change points, especially when a dominant change point masks other change points, (c) check each point is a change point or not, thus increase computation extensively. We present a novel offline algorithm which uses a dynamic mode decomposition based data-driven dynamical system and local adaptive window to iteratively detect variance change points. We propose a variance descriptor function which is used for guiding the focus-of-attention of change points. For detecting change points, it is used for generating regions of interest and providing coarse information, which automatically governs the location and the size of window to detect change points at different scales. The proposed algorithm is completely data driven, doesn't require a probabilistic model, and detects multiple variance change points accurately and efficiently on many time series.},

  abstract = {Motivated by neuroscience applications, we introduce the concept of qualitative detection, that is, the problem of determining on-line the current qualitative dynamical behavior (e.g., resting, oscillating, bursting, spiking etc.) of a nonlinear system. The approach is thought for systems characterized by i) large parameter variability and redundancy, ii) a small number of possible robust, qualitatively different dynamical behaviors and, iii) the presence of sharply different characteristic timescales. These properties are omnipresent in neurosciences and hamper quantitative modeling and fitting of experimental data. As a result, novel control theoretical strategies are needed to face neuroscience challenges like on-line epileptic seizure detection. The proposed approach aims at detecting the current dynamical behavior of the system and whether a qualitative change is likely to occur without quantitatively fitting any model nor asymptotically estimating any parameter. We talk of qualitative detection. We rely on the qualitative properties of the system dynamics, extracted via singularity and singular perturbation theories, to design low dimensional qualitative detectors. We introduce this concept on a general class of singularly perturbed systems and then solve the problem for an analytically tractable class of two-dimensional systems with a single unknown sigmoidal nonlinearity and two sharply separated timescales. Numerical results are provided to show the performance of the designed qualitative detector.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an Adaptable and Interpretable Framework for Anomaly Detection (AID) designed for industrial systems utilizing IoT data streams on top of well-established SCADA systems. AID leverages dynamic conditional probability distribution modeling to capture the normal operation of dynamic systems and isolate the root causes of anomalies at the level of individual inputs. The self-supervised framework dynamically updates parameters of underlying model, allowing it to adapt to non-stationarity. AID interprets anomalies as significant deviations from conditional probability, encompassing interactions as well as both spatial and temporal irregularities by exposing them as features. Crucially, AID provides dynamic operating limits to integrate with existing alarm handling mechanisms in SCADA-based IoT systems. Two industrial-scale case studies demonstrate AID's capabilities. The first study showcases AID's effectiveness on energy storage system, adapting to changes, setting context-aware limits for SCADA, and ability to leverage a physics-based model. The second study monitors battery module temperatures, where AID identifies hardware faults, emphasizing its relevance to energy storage safety. A benchmark evaluation on real data shows that AID delivers comparable performance to other self-learning adaptable anomaly detection methods, with the significant advancement in diagnostic capabilities for improved system reliability and performance.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach to change-point detection when the observed high-dimensional data may have missing elements. The performance of classical methods for change-point detection typically scales poorly with the dimensionality of the data, so that a large number of observations are collected after the true change-point before it can be reliably detected. Furthermore, missing components in the observed data handicap conventional approaches. The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the dynamic distribution underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying low-dimensional submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space. Specifically, streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation, measure deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of statistics of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has changed in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper leverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data analysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale analysis techniques for point clouds, online optimization, and change-point detection performance analysis. Simulations and experiments highlight the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise slowly varying low-dimensional manifold.},

We consider this problem within the framework of non-Bayesian change-point detection. We study the Gaussian case first. A scan-statistic akin to the Shewhart chart is proposed, based on the operator norm of the sample matrix. By assuming the observation dimension grows to infinity, we could characterize the average run length (ARL) and the probability of missing detection (Type-II error) through the asymptotic theory of random matrices; under the non-asymptotic circumstances, we establish a sharp lower bound on the ARL. In a contrast, we derive the exact subspace-CUSUM procedure with complete information about the model parameter and introduce the subspace-CUSUME algorithm to handle the situation with some unidentified parameter. We recapitulate some optimal properties relative to the classical CUSUM statistic. The spectral-based algorithm could be extended to a class of non-Gaussian models where entries of the Wigner noise follow i.i.d sub-exponential distributions. We present part of comparable analysis results as in the Gaussian case and discuss the qualitative relationships among ARL and other parameters in depth. Finally, we corroborate corresponding theoretical conclusions through numerical simulations.},

  abstract = { Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal decomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of “windowed DMD,” in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble. },
